This is a collection of assets from some Unity projects I made as a child.
Unity was my main hobby for several years, and I did a lot with it.

It's interesting to see my coding skill develop over time, unfortunately I never dated anything,
nor do I have much good memory of the order/timing of the projects.

Maybe I'll remake a few of these some day.
